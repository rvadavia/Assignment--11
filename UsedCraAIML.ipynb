    "As a used car dealer, staying on top of the constantly changing market value of your cars is an essential part of running a successful business. To remain competitive in this space, predicting the true worthof each vehicle based on its attributes can be critical to accurate pricing and increased customer interest. Developing a predictive model that considers factors such as make, model year, mileage and condition could help ensure you get more bang for your buck when setting prices and attract new customers."

By randomly selecting K centroids and iteratively assigning them until convergence is reached, we can gain valuable insight about how car attributes shape their market value!"
